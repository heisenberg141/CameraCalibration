# Camera Calibration
This repository contains implementation of a automatic Camera Calibration routine to find out intrinsic and extrinsic parameters with radial distortion. Refer to the [paper](cam_calib.pdf) to see the implementation details of the algorithm.

## Running the code
1. Download the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. Run python3 wrapper.py
